# Blog II: Decide while learning Unity and EarSketch

### Learning Unity
At first, I started with tutorials and watch many videos on Unity. I explored the different projects 
that you can make with Unity going from the easy ones to the games that need a year or half a year.
This helps me imagine the possible ideas and games I can create using 8 weeks and with only 1 GB of cloud space.
From the first blog I had an idea to create a multiplayer game, so most of the tutorial I looked at helped me get close to creating
my game idea. One of the videos I watched is about how to make a cube move with arrow keys, which involves C#.

In the C# script Update() method, I added the following code: 
    
    if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.LeftArrow)) {
    Vector3 position = this.transform.position;
    position.x--;
    this.transform.position = position;
    }

I realize I might need to learn C# if I want to make my game and a lot of things seem confusing to me even after looking at the 
basics of C#. For some days I looked at making games without code, the image below is a video I watched when I search make a game 
without code in Unity.
+ Title: MAKE GAMES WITHOUT CODE! - Unity 3D Game Kit

I spend the rest of the days downloading the 3D kit and playing around with the functions in it, but it looks like the end result would
be something like the example in the game kit, with same characters, enemy, skills, etc. Unless I make my own character and learn C#, the 
game will not be super original. I still don't know what to do most of the time I just look at different videos for Unity and EarSketch.

### Learning EarSketch
EarSketch was really fun for me. In the beginning, I didn't like a lot of the music I heard in different EarSketch projects. That is why I 
kind of gave up on EarSketch, but for some reason I always go back to it. It is like whenever I hear a song I think about the music I 
might be able to create. Also I am watching this show about these individual producers creating their own music and competing to become 
the top original music producers in China. These inspire me to look more into EarSketch. I basically heard a lot of the beats and created
two of my own music, I also learned the basic python language you need for EarSketch. I will be focusing on EarSketch, to create music for 
a Unity project/game (a collaboration project)



# Takeaways
1. **Do not just do what others do** I felt like I just went with what my friends did, that is why I was so confuse at times. Now I know 
I want to focus on EarSketch more and only the basic of Unity.
2. **Don't do multiple languages in a short amount of time** I was trying the advance things in Unity while also learning a lot of things in 
EarSketch. This made things really hard and I didn't get much done.
3. **No time is being wasted when you tinker** Although you might of used a lot of time playing around with different languages or platform
,but it is not wasting time because that way you will clearly know what you want to do.
