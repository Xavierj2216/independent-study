# Blog III: EarSketch tutorial and music

Now I have learned a lot of the basics in EarSketch and understand how to make a song. During this week I was looking at more 
functions in EarSketch and creating different music. I have multiple files with complete songs, but these songs aren't good. That is why I need to work more on the transition between different clips and to create a more catchy beat. I also saw many videos and guides on how to write lyrics, create good melody, make beats like some popular DJs, and etc.  

### Learning EarSketch
The music or code I was working on in EarSketch python script. The below is only a part of it:

    from earsketch import *
    init()
    setTempo(120)
    # Music
    # drums1 = RD_ROCK_POPRHYTHM_DRUM_PART_10
    beatFill = RD_ROCK_POPRHYTHM_MAINDRUMS_1
    drumFill = RD_EDM_DRUMBEATPART_1
    # Clip
    insertMedia(RD_POP_SFX_FMDOWN_1,1,1,3)
    fitMedia(RD_POP_PADCHORD_2,2,2.9,6.9)

I realize I might need to learn C# if I want to make my game and a lot of things seem confusing to me even after looking at the 
basics of C#. For some days I looked at making games without code, the image below is a video I watched when I search to make a game 
without code in Unity.
+ Title: MAKE GAMES WITHOUT CODE! - Unity 3D Game Kit

I spend the rest of the days downloading the 3D kit and playing around with the functions in it, but it looks like the end result would
be something like the example in the game kit, with same characters, enemy, skills, etc. Unless I make my own character and learn C#, the 
game will not be super original. I still don't know what to do most of the time I just look at different videos for Unity and EarSketch.

### Learning EarSketch
EarSketch was really fun for me. In the beginning, I didn't like a lot of the music I heard in different EarSketch projects. That is why I kind of gave up on EarSketch, but for some reason, I always go back to it. It is like whenever I hear a song I think about the music I 
might be able to create. Also, I am watching this show about these individual producers creating their own music and competing to become 
the top original music producers in China. These inspire me to look more into EarSketch. I basically heard a lot of the beats and created
two of my own music, I also learned the basic python language you need for EarSketch. I will be focusing on EarSketch, to create music for 
a Unity project/game (a collaboration project).



# Takeaways
1. **Do not just do what others do** I felt like I just went with what my friends did, that is why I was so confused at times. Now I know 
I want to focus on EarSketch more and only the basic of Unity.
2. **Don't do multiple languages in a short amount of time** I was trying the advance things in Unity while also learning a lot of things in EarSketch. This made things really hard and I didn't get much done.
3. **No time is being wasted when you tinker** Although you might have used a lot of time playing around with different languages or platform,but it is not wasting time because that way you will clearly know what you want to do.
