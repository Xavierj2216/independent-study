# Blog 1: Exploring Topics

### Picking a Topic
At first, I asked some people outside and in school about what topic I should learn, many suggest Java and C++. 
I did some research and looked at videos and projects to decide, but it was still pretty hard to choose. 
I also looked at the list of languages or studies that previous students did and found Unity and EarSketch. 
I thought that maybe I should do Java just because it is used a lot and can be beneficial in the future, like high wage or more demand. 
This was not a good reason because I won't enjoy these nine weeks and I might not be able to persevere when things get difficult. 
That is why I choose Unity a platform that is capable of creating 3D games. This is what I like more compare to
writing code or designing a website. Unity is more visual and less coding with text/syntax.

### C++ tinker?
C++ is a more object-oriented programming language that is widely used to create applications, games, web, engines, etc. C++ is more of reading closer, 
to handle a lot more detail and memory management. It takes a lot more code to get things done to compare to other languages like Java. 
I saw some of the games you can create like Snake and tic-tac-toe but it just doesn't seem like the kind of game I want to make with a bunch of code.
The systems you can create might be beneficial, or worth learning but it just doesn't seem fun to create hospital management or school.

### EarSketch tinker?
EarSketch seems pretty fun to me when I read the description, I did research and it was like a platform to create music or beats. 
I thought I would be able to create songs and cool music that I like, it was like finding something that would allow more possibilities.
I saw how singers create their songs or DJs making EDM music, so EarSketch seems interesting. 
EarSketch uses Python and Javascript, which is not a problem for me. The problem is that I saw projects or music that is made from EarSketch, and it was only beat. 
There was no voice and I don't like the music created. It gave me a bad first impression.

### Why Unity?
Unity brings the vision to life, it is something I can use to create things from my imagination. Just from opening the Unity homepage I was fascinated it was so pretty
and the games are so cool. It allows 3D development and I played some of the games created before. 
I saw videos and tutorials, like what you can make in a certain time span. 
This worries me a little because this person created a stick figure game that looks cool but took longer than the time I have. 
Unity has a free version, but there are limitations like only being able to upload 1GB to Cloud. 
I will try my best in these 9 weeks and Unity uses C++ and C#, so I will also be learning popular languages. 

### Possible Idea
Game idea
Start with a cube or at least a shape
Be able to move around
The concept is team-based, with 3 shapes, the team that fills out move space wins
Maybe have a time or whoever fills out all the space
There will be different maps like 10x10 or more, there can be a 1v1, 3v3, or 5v5 and the maps will be different
Each team will have a color, space or square they pass by will turn to their team color
To make things more fun there will be skills like a stun or being able to turn big or get multiple spaces, other abilities can be added
There will be a 3-sec count down before they start.

# Takeaways
1. **Google is your best friend.** Google really help me decide what to do, through research I found what different languages could do and projects or videos that
show the results of learning the language. Google will definitely help me answer my questions and problems in the future when dealing with Unity. 

2. **Choose sometime that interest you or seems fun to you.** There might be languages that are more valuable or beneficial for future jobs, but
having fun is more important. You don't want to feel miserable at hard times.
