# Blog IV: EarSketch produce and edit

I am almost done with learning EarSketch, and understand most of the methods and function that help make the music. Now my biggest 
problem is still with the song, to create a good song. Most of the songs I created sounds fine after listening to it a few times, but it 
starts getting boring. There is also no part that makes me feel like I want to dance with the music. Maybe it is because I have no
experience with music producing or it is the amount of beats that are in EarSketch. I always feel like there is not much sounds, and so 
I want to look for other platforms that creates beats and upload that to EarSketch. I also tried to get sounds from other websites
or online, but most of it needs money. The free sounds are limited and is not what I'm looking for.
