# Blog III: EarSketch tutorial and music

Now I have learned a lot of the basics in EarSketch and understand how to make a song. During this week I was looking at more 
functions in EarSketch and creating different music. I have multiple files with complete songs, but these songs aren't good. That is why I need to work more on the transition between different clips and to create a more catchy beat. I also saw many videos and guides on how to write lyrics, create good melody, make beats like some popular DJs, and etc.

    drumFill = RD_EDM_DRUMBEATPART_1
    # Clip

    fitMedia(RD_POP_PADCHORD_2,2,2.9,6.9)
