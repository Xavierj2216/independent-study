# Blog IV: Back to Unity

This week I was mainly focused on Unity because I finish the EarSketch song that I needed to create for the game. That was one of the main purpose I learned EarSketch. However, I might still go back and play around with it next time. The game is almost done, we needed a UI and menu with buttons. That was the part I tried to make this week. I started with multiple tutorials like how to create a UI, play button, pause and resume, and etc. We wanted a simple button and UI because the SEP expo is coming up soon. I started to create the button while following the tutorial, the first creation had different functions like volume with a slider, check box, and 3 other buttons. My group didn't want that so I had to delete it and just make two buttons, which are resume and quit. The play button is in a different scene along with the title. After creating the resume and quit buttons my group didn't like it because it looks too simple. Then I went to search again for a better looking resume and quit button tutorial. I followed the tutorial and made two buttons with C Sharp code, but the code didn't work so I had to delete it. That was all for the resume and quit buttons. Now I need to make the play button. I found a tutorial for that and made it in school. I saved the file but realize I send myself the wrong file when I got home. Finally, I recreated the play button and added a title and send it all to my groupmates.

# Takeaways
1. **Communicate with your groupmates (clearly):** The reason why I had to continuously change the button and the visual appearance was because we didn't have a clear communication of what we want. In the beginning I was just told to make a UI and buttons. 
2. **Tutorials provide great help:** I learn faster with tutorials compare to just diving right into the program and try to figure things out.
