# Blog IV: EarSketch produce and edit

I am almost done with learning EarSketch, and understand most of the methods and function that help make the music. Now my biggest 
problem is still with the song, to create a good song. Most of the songs I created sounds fine after listening to it a few times, but it 
starts getting boring. There is also no part that makes me feel like I want to dance with the music. Maybe it is because I have no
experience with music producing or it is the amount of beats that are in EarSketch. I always feel like there is not much sounds, and so 
I want to look for other platforms that creates beats and upload that to EarSketch. I also tried to get sounds from other websites
or online, but most of it needs money. The free sounds are limited and is not what I'm looking for.

#### The basics, the keywords and functions in EarSketch
+ Strings are used with the makeBeat() function to create rhythmic patterns

+ makeBeat() takes four arguments:
  + clipName: The clip a beat is constructed from.
  + trackNumber: The track on which music is placed.
  + measureNumber: The starting measure of the beat. The beat string determines the total length.
  + beatString: A string that specifies the rhythm created.
+ '0' starts playing the clip.
+ '-' is a rest, meaning that thereâ€™s nothing being played.
+ '+' extends the sound clip into the next sixteenth-note sub-beat

+ The basic components of a for-loop
  + Ex: Ex: for measure in range(1,4):
+ Loop Body: The body of a loop contains statements that will execute repeatedly. 
+ Loop Counter: Creates a variable to be used as a loop counter.

+ Range: A function that makes a list of numbers for the loop counter to count through. 
  + range() takes two arguments, 
    +range(startingNumber, endingNumber).
    +a starting point (inclusive)
    +ending point (exclusive)
+ randint() produces a random number takes two arguments
  +randint(1, 5)
  +minimum and maximum

+ There seems to be a way to add image and animation along with your song.
  + importImage
  
+ Tips for debugging
  + Produce the error
  + Read the console for clues
  + Locate the error in your code
  + Take action to fix it
  + Ask for help
  
+ Hard Coding: Writing data values directly into the code
+ User Input: Asking the user to input information (ex. raw_input())

### My EarSketch songs
+ 3 songs total

### Download other platform
+ To create better sounding songs I installed FL Studio and tinkered with it
+ So far I'm trying to see if I should learn more about this platform to combine it with EarSketch 
+ I will also focus on making music for the collaboration project with a few other classmate.

# Takeaways
1. **Try new things and have fun:** EarSketch beats are limited, so I plan to try Garageband or other platforms.
2. **By now try to get some product or at least start your project**
