# Blog III: EarSketch tutorial and music

Now I have learned a lot of the basics in EarSketch and understand how to make a song. During this week I was looking at more 
functions in EarSketch and creating different music. I have multiple files with complete songs, but these songs aren't good. That is why I need to work more on the transition between different clips and to create a more catchy beat. I also saw many videos and guides on how to write lyrics, create good melody, make beats like some popular DJs, and etc.  

### Learning EarSketch
The music or code I was working on in EarSketch python script. The below is only a part of it:

    drumFill = RD_EDM_DRUMBEATPART_1
    # Clip
    insertMedia(RD_POP_SFX_FMDOWN_1,1,1,3)
    fitMedia(RD_POP_PADCHORD_2,2,2.9,6.9)

# Takeaways
1. **Always remember to learn the basic, but donâ€™t just learn do it:** I read and looked at a bunch of tutorials but I forgot half of it because I never tried it out myself. In the past I heard others say to use the code while you learn now I know why.
2. **It is easy to create something but hard to make it good:** I created multiple beats/song but it is really hard to make it catchy or have great melody.
3. **Ask for suggestions** Throughout the process of making music I ask multiple people what they they about the song and what I should add. This is for improvement in my music.
